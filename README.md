Hi!
To test my basic knowledge in Python i created a mini project in python , its called " Sql_Quiz_game".
i used python functions and other methods to createt this game. Here i can take inputs from users and then convert those inputs into strings . then user get to give answers to five
questions. At the  end they get to know about their scores and percentages.



Thank you For Visiting... :)
